# Obsidian-PDF
Plugin to enable PDF files as first class citizens within an Obsidian vault.

## What does this plugin do for me?

- All PDF files in your vault will be paired with auto-generated .md files.
- Everytime the PDF file is updated, so is the .md file.
- Opening either file within a pairing will open both files in a dual-pane
editing view within Obsidian.
- You may include custom data within the .md, just ensure to place it after
the "PDF Metadata" heading.
- Any data within the .md that comes before this heading is volatile and will
be overwritten each time the PDF changes.

Please use this plugin at your own risk.
